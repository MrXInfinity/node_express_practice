# Node and Express Practice

This is my own personal practices on a tutorial made by [John Smilga](https://github.com/john-smilga). You can follow along with the tutorial from [Youtube](https://youtu.be/rltfdjcXjmk)

## To Practice on your own

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/john-smilga/node-express-course.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd node-express-course
```

To go to each project `cd {projectName}` so for 01-node-tutorial the code would look like this. 

```bash
  cd 01-node-tutorial
```
Starting from the 3rd project, each projectName has starter and final files so you might need to `cd starter` and then you need to install the dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

Start the server

```bash
  npm run start
```
